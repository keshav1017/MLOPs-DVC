1. Create git repo and clone it in local.
2. Create code.py and add code to it (it will save a csv file to a new "data" folder)
3. Do a git add-commit-push before initializing dvc.
4. Now we do "dvc init" (creates .dvcignore, .dvc)
5. Now do "mkdir s3" (creates a new S3 directory)
6. Now we "dvc remote add -d myremote S3".
7. Next "dvc add data/"
   Now it will ask to do: ("git rm -r --cached 'data'" and "git commit -m "Stop tracking data")
   Because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.
8. Again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "add .gitignore data.dvc"
9. Now do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage as first version data.
10. Now make changes to mycode.py to append a new row in data, check changes via "dvc status"
11. Again - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
12. Then git add-commit-push (we are adding v2 of our data)
13. Check dvc/status everything should be up to date
14. Now repeat step 10-12 for v3 of data.
